# Threat-Detect
2XB3 Project 
Uses the dataset containing 250000+ gun violence incidents from 2013 - 2018 to allow the general public to be aware of the incidents that took place near their location, and how prone the location is to gun violence giving a scope of whether gun violence laws in the area need to be reconsidered, and allowing the user to be more aware and vigilant in the area of interest.
