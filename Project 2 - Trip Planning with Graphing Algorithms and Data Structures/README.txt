This project was to test knowledge of using graphing algorithms to solve a problem of planning the cheapest 
and shortest trip from one city to the destinition city in the US. The first approach used Breadth-First Directed Paths,
and Depth-First Directed Paths, and the second approach was to use dijkstra's algorithm to plan the shortest and cheapest
trip with edge-weighted approach where the edges represent the food cost in each city. Many of the data structures used to
solve this problem and manipulated to fit the context of this problem are from https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/; Princeton
